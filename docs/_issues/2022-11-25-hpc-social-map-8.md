To confirm entries and potentially allow checking to reduce duplication, we could add an email address field to the form and send a confirmation link that would have to be followed before posting the entry. The email could also be used to cut down on duplicate entries and allow people to make revisions (only the most recent entry i each category from a given email address would be kept, and text to that effect could be included in the confirmation email for clarity.) 

With this additional security, we could allow people to enter information such as social media identities (possible optional field in each category) and URLs (for groups) with more confidence.
