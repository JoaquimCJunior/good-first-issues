Another piece of feedback from the CZI EOSS kickoff meeting that @WillAyd and I attended:

The current https://pandas.io/ home page has 2 `Getting started` links:

The upper right one in the top ribbon leads to https://pandas.io/getting_started.html
The bottom left one leads to https://pandas.io/docs/getting_started/index.html

People found it confusing that they linked to different pages and did not completely contain the same information. From a user experience perspective, it would be great to have these point to the same page, especially since both pages essentially have the same information.
